    <p> ♥ On this day was born one beautiful Princess, and fortunately she fell in love with me and made me feel like the luckiest guy in the world. So I will do everything for her majesty. Happy birthday, my princess!!!</p>
    <br>
    <p> ♥ You take the biggest place in my heart and I wouldn’t know what to do without you.</p>
    <br>
   <p> ♥ You make me feel complete and thank you very much for all the support that you gave to me.</p>
    <br>
    <p>♥ You are the first thing that comes to my mind when I wake up and the last thing that comes to my mind before I go to sleep.</p> 
    <br>
    <p>♥ Because you are so special, may this special day of your life be filled with very special things that life can offer. Happy birthday, sweetheart.</p>
